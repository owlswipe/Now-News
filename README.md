## Now News

Now News is an beautiful, personalized way to get local weather (powered by <a href="forecast.io">forecast.io</a>) and breaking news (powered by <a href="https://developer.nytimes.com/">The New York Times</a> API and rss feeds from <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Site/page/rss--3520115">ABC News</a>, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/10628494">BBC News</a>, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/rss.xml">Engadget Tech</a>, and <a href="http://www.foxsports.com/other/rss">Fox Sports</a>). It's visually striking, and is well optimized for mobile devices too. It remembers who and where you are, and can be bookmarked for easy access on all of your devices.

Now News is made by a student with HTML and CSS (Materialize makes it look pretty!), with the backend handled by Ruby and Sinatra. No ads, no account needed, jump right in: <a href="http://now-news.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Now News</a>.

<strong>Now News works perfectly on mobile <i>and</i> desktop browsers.</strong>
