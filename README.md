##Now News


Now News is a really easy, personalized way to get local weather (powered by <a href="forecast.io">forecast.io</a>) and breaking news (powered by APIs from The New York Times & Bing News and RSS Feeds from ABC News, BBC News, & Engadget Tech) anywhere you are. It's visually striking, and pretty well optimized for mobile devices too. It remembers who and where you are, and can be bookmarked for easy access on all of your devices.

Now News is made by a student with HTML and CSS (Materialize makes it look pretty!), with the backend handled by Ruby and Sinatra. No ads, no account needed, jump right in: <a href="now-news.herokuapp.com">Now News</a>.
